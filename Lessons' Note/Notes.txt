# Listening to Events and Event Handlers
To call a function inside the our components, we can use the EVENT HANDLER (onClick, onChange 
and many others) to achiev this. 
Event Handlers are properties that allow us to trigger functions. To do this, we need to pass a 
function to these properties, and we do this by callings directly (inside the property) or indire-
try (by "pointing" to the function).

<button onClick={function} /> 
                OR 
<button o onChange={() =>{function()}} />

It's good to note that, if we call this way: <button onClick={function()} />, the function will
trigger when the component be mounted.
