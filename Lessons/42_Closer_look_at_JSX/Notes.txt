This lesson calls out attention to the libs that we import in package.json, the "react" and 
"react-dom". The react-dom lib is used in the App.js to mount our tree of components in the
DOM, but the react lib it's not used. It's not used because early in the React Framework, the
developers needed to to use this lib to create the element in the DOM, it was too complicated,
but fortunally, this is not necessary anymore. 

It's good to say that this lib isn't already dead, it's still used in Typescript, but in ano-
ther concept and way.
