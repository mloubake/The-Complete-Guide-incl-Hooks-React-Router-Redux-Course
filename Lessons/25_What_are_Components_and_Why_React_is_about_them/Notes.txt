Important concepts: Reusability and Separation of Concerns

- Reusability
This concept is about to reuse ("repeat") parts of a code to minify the entire code (project, 
lines of code), making you that don't repeat yourself with the same things. 
Example: Make a button component that, wherever you need a button, that button can be used again
and again, without to making a new button, economizing time.

- Separaion of Concerns
Also known as SOC, this concept is about to remove all concern of a single file and splitting
them to smaller parts, making them to do only one clear task, one concern. This makes these
small pieces of code easy to manage and maintain.
