React is all about components.

- How is a component built?
In React, a component is created by combining HTML, CSS and Javascript, and all together
creates a user interface. Just only HTML and Javascript is necessary, the CSS is not the focus of
React, but can be used to make the UI beautiful.

- React and Components.
In summary, React is all about components and about building these components together. React 
allows us to create these re-usable and reactive components.

React uses something which is called a Declarative Approach for building these components. It 
basically means that with React, you will not tell React that a certaing HTML element should be
created and inserted in a specific place on the user interface as in vanilla javascript. With 
React you define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual Javascript DOM
instruction.
