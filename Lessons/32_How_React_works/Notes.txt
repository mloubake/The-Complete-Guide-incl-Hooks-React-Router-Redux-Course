Complementing the previous lesson, JSX allows us to write components (code) in a declarative way, 
or in a not imperative way. Imperative is like coding giving clear instruction, becoming
very cumbersome. Like this:

const paragraph = document.createElement('paragraph');
paragraph.textContent = 'This is also visible';
document.getElementById('root').append(paragraph);

This is the way we do with regular javascript. But now, with declarative way, we can set the 
place and state and React will do all the magic behind the scene.
