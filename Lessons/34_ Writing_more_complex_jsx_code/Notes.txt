- Important rule of using a JSX elements.
JSX elements cannot be declared without a parent/root element without wrapping them 
in the RETURN of the element function, this is rule must be followed in every snippet.

Example:

//Wrong Snippet                                         //Correct Snippet
function ExpenseItem() {                                function ExpenseItem() {    
    return(                                                 return(
        <div>Date</div>                                         <div> //root/parent div
        <div>                                                       <div>Date</div>
            <h2>Title</h2>                                          <div>
            <div>Amount</div>                                           <h2>Title</h2>
        </div>;)                                                        <div>Amount</div>
}                                                                   <div>
                                                                <div>
export default ExpenseItem;                             }

                                                        export default ExpenseItem;

We can see that in the second example, a div root is wrapping the main part of this code, this
need to be declared because the component returns only one component, this is alos good,
because keeps the code readable and maintainable. It's good to mention that we don't need to wrap 
the element only with div, we can use any other html element, we can also use 
Fragments (<></> (don't create a element in the DOM)), and elements that of any CSS libraries, 
like: <Container/> from Styled-Components library, and much more.
