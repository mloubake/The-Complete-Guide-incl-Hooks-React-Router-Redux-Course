In this lesson we will turn the ExpenseItem Component more dynamically, but not full dynamically,
creating new variables to use them inside the JSX, using the curly braces ('{ }'). 
We gonna also use the Date class to make generate a date with arguments, this new date is better 
to use than a HARDCODE date, of course it will not be the better solution, but it is a progress.

This new date can be created and used like this:

function ExpenseItem() {
    //Creates a new date
    const date = new Date(2021, 6, 21)

    return(
        <div>
            //ISOString is some of few methods to generate a date
            {date.toISOString()} //Result: 2022-07-21T03:00:00.000Z
        </div>
    )
}

The new date is a little better to read than July 21th 2022, but most importantly, its better
to use, remembering. This is not the best way, but it's something.

Observations:
- Hardcode is the name for a code that is written by someone and can't be changed dinamically.
To change, the person that wrote, need to change everytime, and this is a nonsense in a modern
app. Modern apps need to have the capability to change it's data any time. 

Disclaimer: Hardcode it's not well seen (generally), but it can be used sometimes, depending on
the context.

- Some Date.now methods:
* toISOString() //Result: 2022-07-21T03:00:00.000Z
* toDateString() //Result: Thu Jul 21 2022
* toLocaleDateString() //Result: 21/07/2022
* Methods "getSomething
    ** getDate() //Result: 21
    ** getDay() //Result: 4
    ** getFullYear() //Result: 2022
    ** getHours() //Result: 0
