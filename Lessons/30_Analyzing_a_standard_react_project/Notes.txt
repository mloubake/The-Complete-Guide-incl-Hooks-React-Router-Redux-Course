We can see in the analysis that a react project has some important concepts that makes a react 
unique, or at least, different. The SPA, JSX, libraries.

- SPA
Single Page Application a.k.a. SPA, is a concept that utilize only one HTML page to build the 
entire project. This one page needs to be rendered only and reload a piece of the DOM when it 
changes, making the page much faster than a regular page. Is worth mention that all the code 
(everything) is rendered inside this single HTML page.

- JSX
JSX is a concept that bind together HTML and JS. This type of file allow us to use HTML inside 
Javascript, allowing us to make a dynamically page, when constructing components and pages that
can change whenever we wanted.

- Libraries 
Although this is not a concept, Libraries are used to help us construct a better page, they 
can be native (installed when we create a project) or third-party libraries. 
They are stored in a folder called node_moducles (giant heavy folder) and loaded in a file 
called package.json, that holds all dependecies and other useful configurations.
