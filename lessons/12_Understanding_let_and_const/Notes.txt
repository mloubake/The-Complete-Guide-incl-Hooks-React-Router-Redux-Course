There are three KEYWORDS that allow use to create variables, they are: var, let and const

- let: With this keyword, we can create a variable that allow us to change the value of itself.

- const: In the opposite side, this keyword does not allow us to change it's value.

- var: This type of variable is basically the same of let but it's old and almost not used.

From Mozilla's Website:

'let' allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression
on which it is used, unlike the 'var' keyword, which declares a variable globally or locally to an entire
function regardless of block scope.
