Classes are essentially blueprints for objects, in our case is javascript objects. Classes can be created
with the keyword CLASS and a class can have PROPERTIES and METHODS. Methods are simply functions attached
to classes, where properties are variables attached to classes. 

class Person {
    name = 'Max'
    call = () => {...}
}


A class can be INSTANTIATED using the NEW keyword.

const myPerson = new Person()
myPerson.call()
console.log(myPerson.name)
