Easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables. It looks like Spread Opera-
tor but it's different. Spread takes out all elements, all properties and distributes them in a new array 
or object or whatever you are using it. Destructuring allows you to pull out a single element or property
and store them in variables.

- For Array Destructuring:

[a, b] = ['Hello', 'Max']
console.log(a) //Result: Hello
console.log(b) //Result: 'Max'

It looks like we are creating a new array but we are not, we are assigning Hello and Max values to A and B
respectively.



- For Object Destructuring:

{name} = {name: 'Max', age: 28}
console.log(name) //Result: Max
console.log(age) //Result: undefined



Examples:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
[num1, num2] = numbers;
console.log(num1, num2) //Result: 1     2

If we want to target specific values, we can skip some values adding an empty "variable", like this:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
[num1, , num3] = numbers; 
console.log(num1, num3) //Result: 1    3
