Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous function expression. 
The advantages of Arrow Functions above Normal Functions are:
- Time saving when writing a function.
- Concise body sintax.
- Implicit return.
- Shorter version of a normal function.
- No binding of 'this'.

Disadvantages:
- Harder to debug.
- No self-referencing
    If your function needs to have a self-reference at any point (e.g. recursion, event handlers that needs
    to unbind), it will not work.


//Normal Function
function printMyName(name) {
    console.log(name)
}

//Arrow Functions
const printMyName = (name) => {
    console.log(name)
}

or

const printMyName = name => {
    console.log(name)
}

or 

const multiplyByTwo = number => return number*2


printMyName('MyName')
multiplyByTwo(10)
